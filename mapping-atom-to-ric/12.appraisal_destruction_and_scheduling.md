# `appraisal_destruction_and_scheduling`

**Type**: String

---

The `appraisal_destruction_and_scheduling` field describes a specific type of event in a record's life cycle. We model this as a **`rico:Event`**, which is the general class for activities affecting a record. We will use a single `rico:Event` entity to capture the entire narrative, which is attached via the **`rico:generalDescription`** property. We also create a single **`rico:EventType`** to categorize the event. While the AtoM field covers three concepts, we can represent this in RiC-O as a single, combined event type to adhere to the simplest model.

This model connects the following pieces of information:

  - **The record resource**: The record that was affected by the event.
  - **The event**: A `rico:Event` entity that describes the appraisal, destruction, and scheduling activities.
  - **The event type**: A shared `rico:EventType` entity with a single `rdfs:label` that represents the composite nature of the event.
  - **The narrative description**: The long text literal value from AtoM is attached to the `rico:Event` entity using the **`rico:generalDescription`** property.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:Event` (the appraisal/destruction/scheduling event)
2.  `rico:EventType` (shared, to categorize the event)
