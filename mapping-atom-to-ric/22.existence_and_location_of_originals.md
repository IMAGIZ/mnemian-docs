# `existence_and_location_of_originals`

**Type**: String

---

The `existence_and_location_of_originals` field in AtoM contains information about where the original records are physically located. We model this by **reusing the existing `rico:CorporateBody`** entity from the repository field and adding properties to indicate that this institution holds the originals.

This approach leverages the fact that in the first version of Mnemian, we assume that records retrieved from AtoM describe the holdings of the retrieved "repository". The same institution that serves as the repository also holds the originals, so we simply add additional properties to the existing CorporateBody.

**Future Enhancement**: In future versions, Mnemian will enable users to define 'external' Agents who hold described items, allowing for more complex scenarios where the repository and the holder of originals may be different institutions.

This model connects the following pieces of information:

  - **The holding institution**: The same `rico:CorporateBody` entity representing the repository (reused from repository field).
  - **The holder relationship**: `rico:hasOrHadHolder` property linking the record to the CorporateBody.
  - **Location details**: `rico:note` property containing the specific location information from AtoM.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:CorporateBody` (the holding institution - reused from repository field)
2.  `rico:Name` (the name of the institution - reused from repository field)

### Example

```turtle
# EXISTING entities (created from atomData.repository field processing)
:Name_ICA a rico:Name ;
  rico:textualValue "International Council on Archives"@en .

:CorporateBody_ICA a rico:CorporateBody ;
  rico:hasOrHadName :Name_ICA .

# Example record set entity
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet .

# UPDATED CorporateBody (after processing existence_and_location_of_originals)
:CorporateBody_ICA a rico:CorporateBody ;
  rico:hasOrHadName :Name_ICA ;
  rico:note "Location of originals: Originals held at ICA headquarters, Paris, France. Reference: MS-1234."@en .

# Link the record to the holder
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadHolder :CorporateBody_ICA .

# Alternative: If atomData.repository is empty, add to record as general note
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:note "Location of originals: Private collection, contact archivist for access."@en .
```

### Notes
- In future versions, this will support external agents holding originals where the repository and holder may be different institutions
