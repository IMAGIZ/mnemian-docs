# `scripts_of_description`

**Type**: Array of strings

---

The `scripts_of_description` field describes the scripts used in the archival description itself (not the described materials). Since `rico:hasOrHadLanguage` cannot be used with `rico:Instantiation`, we attach this information to the digital "archival description" instantiation using a prefixed textual value via `rico:note`.

We normalize each AtoM script string to a consistent display format in order to produce a readable note value.

The modeling pattern:
- **The archival description instantiation**: The existing `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the AtoM description (created for every resource record).
- **The script information**: A concatenated textual value derived from AtoM values, stored as `rico:note` on the instantiation, with the prefix "Scripts of description: ".
- **Additional context**: Can be combined with existing instantiation properties like `rico:structure` and `rico:carrierType`.

This keeps the model simple and semantically correct by associating scripts with the description instantiation rather than the record resources.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:Instantiation` (the archival description instantiation; holds the note)
2.  `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the described resource; linked via `rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`)

rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart
• rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation ↓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
rico:Instantiation (Archival Description)
• rico:note → "Scripts of description: Latin, Arabic"@en
• rico:structure → "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en
• rico:carrierType → :Digital

### Example

```turtle
# Core record resource
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:title "Administrative Records, 1950-1960"@en .

# Digital archival description instantiation (always present)
:RecordSet_123_archival_desc a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:carrierType :Digital ;
  rico:structure "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en ;
  rico:note "Scripts of description: Latin, Arabic"@en ;
  dc:source "https://atom.example.com/123" .

# Link the instantiation to the record resource
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :RecordSet_123_archival_desc .
```

### Notes
- `rico:hasOrHadLanguage` is not applicable to `rico:Instantiation`, hence the use of `rico:note`.
- We normalize script names for consistency and better readability in UI and exports.
- Future enhancement could introduce a controlled vocabulary note structure, but the current approach intentionally remains simple and non-disruptive to the instantiation model.
