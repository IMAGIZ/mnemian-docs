# `rules_and_or_conventions_used`

**Type**: String

---

The `rules_and_or_conventions_used` field in AtoM describes the rules or conventions used to create the archival description itself (not the described records). This information should be attached to the digital "archival description" instantiation that every resource record has, as it explains the standards used to create that specific instantiation.

The modeling pattern:
- **The archival description instantiation**: The existing `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the AtoM description (created for every resource record).
- **The rules information**: The textual value from AtoM is stored with a prefix using `rico:note` on the instantiation.
- **Additional context**: Optionally, this can be combined with the existing `rico:structure` property that describes the instantiation's format.

This approach correctly associates the rules with the description instantiation rather than the described records, maintaining semantic accuracy while keeping the model simple.

### RiC-O Entities
1. `rico:Instantiation` (archival description instantiation; contains the rules via `rico:note`)
2. `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the described resource; linked via `rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`)

```turtle
# Core record resource
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:title "Administrative Records, 1950-1960"@en .

# Digital archival description instantiation (always present)
:RecordSet_123_archival_desc a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:carrierType :Digital ;
  rico:structure "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en ;
  rico:note "Rules and conventions used: ISAD(G), 2nd ed. International Council on Archives"@en ;
  dc:source "https://atom.example.com/123" .

# Link the instantiation to the record resource
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :RecordSet_123_archival_desc .
