# `"Dates of creation revision deletion"`

**Type**: String

---

The `"Dates of creation revision deletion"` field in AtoM contains unstructured text describing when the archival description was prepared and/or revised. This information should be attached to the digital "archival description" instantiation that every resource record has, as it explains the preparation history of that specific instantiation.

The modeling pattern:
- **The archival description instantiation**: The existing `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the AtoM description (created for every resource record).
- **The dates information**: The textual value from AtoM is stored with a prefix using `rico:note` on the instantiation.
- **Additional context**: This can be combined with the existing `rico:structure` property that describes the instantiation's format.

This approach correctly associates the preparation dates with the description instantiation rather than the described records, maintaining semantic accuracy while keeping the model simple.

### RiC-O Entities
1. `rico:Instantiation` (archival description instantiation; contains the preparation dates via `rico:note`)
2. `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the described resource; linked via `rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`)

```turtle
# Core record resource
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:title "Administrative Records, 1950-1960"@en .

# Digital archival description instantiation (always present)
:RecordSet_123_archival_desc a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:carrierType :Digital ;
  rico:structure "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en ;
  rico:note "Dates of creation revision deletion: Prepared 2023-01-15, revised 2023-03-20"@en ;
  dc:source "https://atom.example.com/123" .

# Link the instantiation to the record resource
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :RecordSet_123_archival_desc .
```

### Notes on preparation dates modeling
- This approach correctly associates the preparation dates with the description instantiation, which is what the AtoM field actually describes.
- The dates describe when the AtoM description was prepared and/or revised, not dates related to the described records.
- Future development may add more structured date tracking or validation workflows without changing the basic instantiation-to-dates relationship.
