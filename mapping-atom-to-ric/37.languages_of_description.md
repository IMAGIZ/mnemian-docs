# `languages_of_description`

**Type**: Array of strings

---

The `languages_of_description` field describes the languages used in the archival description itself (not the described materials). Since `rico:hasOrHadLanguage` cannot be used with `rico:Instantiation`, we attach this information to the digital "archival description" instantiation using a prefixed textual value via `rico:note`.

We still normalize each AtoM language string to an ISO 639-1 code and label (same lookup approach as `languages_of_material`) in order to produce a consistent, human-readable note value.

The modeling pattern:
- **The archival description instantiation**: The existing `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the AtoM description (created for every resource record).
- **The language information**: A concatenated textual value derived from AtoM values and lookups, stored as `rico:note` on the instantiation, with the prefix "Languages of description: ".
- **Additional context**: Can be combined with existing instantiation properties like `rico:structure` and `rico:carrierType`.

This keeps the model simple and semantically correct by associating languages with the description instantiation rather than the record resources.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:Instantiation` (the archival description instantiation; holds the note)
2.  `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the described resource; linked via `rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`)

### Example

```turtle
# Core record resource
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:title "Administrative Records, 1950-1960"@en .

# Digital archival description instantiation (always present)
:RecordSet_123_archival_desc a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:carrierType :Digital ;
  rico:structure "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en ;
  rico:note "Languages of description: en (English), fr (French)"@en ;
  dc:source "https://atom.example.com/123" .

# Link the instantiation to the record resource
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :RecordSet_123_archival_desc .
```

### Notes
- `rico:hasOrHadLanguage` is not applicable to `rico:Instantiation`, hence the use of `rico:note`.
- We preserve ISO normalization for consistency and better readability in UI and exports.
- Future enhancement could introduce a controlled vocabulary note structure, but the current approach intentionally remains simple and non-disruptive to the instantiation model.
