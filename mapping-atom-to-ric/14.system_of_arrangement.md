# `system_of_arrangement`

**Type**: String

---

The `system_of_arrangement` field in AtoM describes how the records are organized. We model this as a direct property of the record resource using **`rico:recordResourceStructure`**. This approach is optimal because the property is specifically designed to capture the organizational and structural information of a record, providing a straightforward and semantically accurate way to model this literal value.

The `rico:recordResourceStructure` property is defined as:

  * **Domain**: `rico:RecordResource` (which includes `rico:RecordSet`, `rico:Record`, `rico:RecordPart`). This ensures it can be used on all levels of description.
  * **Range**: `rdfs:Literal`. This means it holds a free-text string, which is perfect for a narrative field like system of arrangement.
