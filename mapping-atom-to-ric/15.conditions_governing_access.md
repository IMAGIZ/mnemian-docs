# `conditions_governing_access`

**Type**: String

---

The `conditions_governing_access` field in AtoM describes the restrictions on the use and access of a record. We model this as a direct property of the record resource using **`rico:conditionsOfAccess`**. This approach is optimal because the property is specifically designed to capture information about access conditions, making it a direct and semantically accurate way to model this literal value.

The `rico:conditionsOfAccess` property is defined as:

  * **Domain**: `rico:RecordResource` (which includes `rico:RecordSet`, `rico:Record`, `rico:RecordPart`). This ensures it can be used on all levels of description.
  * **Range**: `rdfs:Literal`. This means it holds a free-text string, which is perfect for a narrative field like access conditions.
