# `level_of_detail`

**Type**: String

---

The `level_of_detail` field in AtoM describes the completeness of the archival description itself (not the described records). This information should be attached to the digital "archival description" instantiation that every resource record has, as it explains the level of detail of that specific instantiation.

The modeling pattern:
- **The archival description instantiation**: The existing `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the AtoM description (created for every resource record).
- **The level of detail information**: The textual value from AtoM (Full, Partial, or Minimal) is stored with a prefix using `rico:note` on the instantiation.
- **Additional context**: This can be combined with the existing `rico:structure` property that describes the instantiation's format.

This approach correctly associates the level of detail with the description instantiation rather than the described records, maintaining semantic accuracy while keeping the model simple.

### RiC-O Entities
1. `rico:Instantiation` (archival description instantiation; contains the level of detail via `rico:note`)
2. `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the described resource; linked via `rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`)

### Example

```turtle
# Core record resource
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:title "Administrative Records, 1950-1960"@en .

# Digital archival description instantiation (always present)
:RecordSet_123_archival_desc a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:carrierType :Digital ;
  rico:structure "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en ;
  rico:note "Level of detail: Full"@en ;
  dc:source "https://atom.example.com/123" .

# Link the instantiation to the record resource
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :RecordSet_123_archival_desc .
```

### Notes on level of detail modeling
- This approach correctly associates the level of detail with the description instantiation, which is what the AtoM field actually describes.
- The level of detail values (Full, Partial, Minimal) indicate the completeness of the AtoM description, not the completeness of the described records.
- Future development may add more structured completeness tracking or validation workflows without changing the basic instantiation-to-level relationship.
