# `accruals`

**Type**: String

---

The `accruals` field in AtoM describes additions to a record resource. This information is a direct property of the record and is modeled using a different property depending on the entity's hierarchical level.

For a record of type **`rico:RecordSet`**, we use the **`rico:accruals`** datatype property. This property is specifically designed to convey information about additions to a record set, such as subsequent accessions.

For all other record resources (`rico:Record` or `rico:RecordPart`), the `rico:accruals` property is not applicable. In this case, we use the more general **`rico:generalDescription`** property, which can be used to describe any aspect of an entity. We prepend the literal with "Accruals: " to retain the original semantic meaning while adhering to the ontology's constraints.
