# `conditions_governing_reproduction`

**Type**: String

---

The `conditions_governing_reproduction` field in AtoM describes restrictions on the use and reproduction of a record. We model this as a direct property of the record resource using **`rico:conditionsOfUse`**. This property is specifically designed to capture information about conditions that govern how a resource may be used, which includes reproduction. This provides a direct and semantically accurate way to model this literal value.

The `rico:conditionsOfUse` property is defined as:

  * **Domain**: `rico:RecordResource` (which includes `rico:RecordSet`, `rico:Record`, `rico:RecordPart`). This ensures it can be used on all levels of description.
  * **Range**: `rdfs:Literal`. This means it holds a free-text string, which is perfect for a narrative field like conditions of use.
