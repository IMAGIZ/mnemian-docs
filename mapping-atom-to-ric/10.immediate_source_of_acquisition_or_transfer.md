# `immediate_source_of_acquisition_or_transfer`

**Type**: String

---

The `immediate_source_of_acquisition_or_transfer` field describes a specific event in the archival history of a record, namely its transfer of custody. We model this as a **`rico:Event`**, which is a general class for occurrences or activities that affect an entity. This is an appropriate approach as it separates the narrative description from the record itself and allows for a more detailed semantic model.

This model connects the following pieces of information:

  - **The record resource**: The record that was affected by the event.
  - **The event**: A `rico:Event` entity that describes the acquisition or transfer.
  - **The event type**: A **`rico:EventType`** entity with a simple `rdfs:label` to categorize the event as an "Acquisition."
  - **The narrative description**: The long text literal value from AtoM is attached to the `rico:Event` entity using the **`rico:generalDescription`** property.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:Event` (the acquisition/transfer)
2.  `rico:EventType` (shared, to categorize the event)
