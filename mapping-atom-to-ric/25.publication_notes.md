# `publication_notes`

**Type**: String

---

The `publication_notes` field in AtoM contains an array of publication references that are about or based on the use of the archival unit. We model this using **`rico:Event`** entities with a shared **`rico:EventType`** to represent each publication as an event that references the record.

This approach provides a semantically rich way to capture publication information, treating each publication as an event that involves or references the archival record. This allows for better querying and future extensibility.

**Future Enhancement**: In future versions, Mnemian will support parsing publication citations to extract structured metadata like authors, dates, and publication details - and/or will provide user features enabling this data to be added. 

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:Event` (each publication as an event)
2.  `rico:EventType` (shared type for all publication events)
3.  `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the record resource being referenced)

# Shared event type for publications
:EventType_Publication a rico:EventType ;
  rdfs:label "Publication"@en .

# Example record set entity
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet .

# Publication events
:Event_Pub1 a rico:Event ;
  rico:hasEventType :EventType_Publication ;
  rico:generalDescription "Long text publication note with citation"@en .

:Event_Pub2 a rico:Event ;
  rico:hasEventType :EventType_Publication ;
  rico:generalDescription "Another publication uses this record resource in an article - citation and web address"@en .

# Link the record to the events
:RecordSet_123 rico:isOrWasAffectedBy :Event_Pub1 , :Event_Pub2 .
```

### Notes
- In future versions, this will support parsing publication citations to extract structured metadata like authors, dates, and publication details
