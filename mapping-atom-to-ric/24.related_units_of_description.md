# `related_units_of_description`

**Type**: String

---

The `related_units_of_description` field in AtoM contains unstructured text describing relationships to other archival units. We model this using a simple **`rico:isRelatedTo`** property on the record resource containing the literal text from AtoM.

This approach provides a straightforward way to capture relationship information in the current version of Mnemian, where the AtoM data contains unstructured text that cannot be reliably parsed into structured relationships.

**Future Enhancement**: In future versions, Mnemian will support parsing and resolving references to create proper `rico:RecordResourceToRecordResourceRelation` entities with structured relationships between specific record resources.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the record resource with the isRelatedTo property)

### Example

```turtle
# Example record set entity with related units information
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:isRelatedTo "See also correspondence series MS-456 for related materials covering the same time period. Additional photographs are held in series MS-789."@en .
```

### Notes
- In future versions, this will be replaced with structured rico:RecordResourceToRecordResourceRelation entities
