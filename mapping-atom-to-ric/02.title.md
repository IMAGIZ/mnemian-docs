# `title`

**Type**: String

---

The `rico:Title` entity is the "conceptual title" of a record, an agent, or another resource. It is the persistent, abstract idea of that title, which can manifest in different textual forms. It connects the following pieces of information:
- **The resource being titled**: The `rico:RecordSet` (`Record`/`RecordPart`) or `rico:Person`, `rico:CorporateBody` (etc.) entity that the title belongs to, which links to the title using `rico:hasOrHadTitle`.
- **The actual text of the title**: In the `rico:textualValue` object property, attached either directly to the `rico:Title` or to one or more `rico:Appellation` entity/entities (see below for more on this).
- **Temporal information**: The time period during which this title was valid by using `rico:Date` and properties like `rico:wasUsedFromDate`, `rico:wasUsedToDate`.
- **Type of title**: Relationships to a `rico:TitleType` entity, if more specific typing is needed (e.g., "Description title," "Cover title," "Short title" etc.).

### RiC-O Entities
1. `rico:Title` (conceptual title, and textual value from AtoM)
2. `rico:TitleType` (shared, default: "Description title")

• rico:hasTitleType ↓

### Example

```turtle
# Define the TitleType (shared) entity and its label
:TitleTypeDescription  a  rico:TitleType ;
    rdfs:label "Description title"@en .

# Create the title entity and set its value and type
:Title_XYZ_Company  a  rico:Title ;
    rico:textualValue "The Records of the XYZ Company"@en ;
    rico:hasTitleType  :TitleTypeDescription .

# Example record set entity (links to its title)
:RecordSet_123  a  rico:RecordSet ;
    rico:hasOrHadTitle  :Title_XYZ_Company .
```

## Where multiple titles exist (complex)...

For multiple titles, we need to use an additional class, `rico:Name`.

### Analogy: A person's name

The RiC-O model for names is similar and can be helpful for understanding titles.
- **Conceptual Person**: The `rico:Person` entity represents the person themselves, with a single, stable identity.
- **Conceptual Name**: A `rico:Name` entity represents the conceptual name. For example, a person might be known by the conceptual name "Elizabeth Windsor."
- **Textual Names**: The `rico:Name` entity can carry one or more textual values over time (modeled with separate `rico:Name` instances if needed), e.g.:
  - `rico:textualValue "Queen Elizabeth II"@en`
  - `rico:textualValue "Elizabeth II"@en`
  - `rico:textualValue "Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor"@en`

This allows a query to find all records associated with "Elizabeth Windsor," regardless of which specific textual appellation was used in the metadata.

### Why this extra layer is necessary

This layered approach is not just for complexity; it is required for semantic clarity and to handle real-world archival data:
- **Handling multiple versions**: An archival series might have been known by several different titles over its lifetime. Instead of overwriting old titles, we can create multiple `rico:Title` entities, each with one or more associated `rico:Name` instances, optionally linked to `rico:Date` entities to indicate when they were valid.
- **Capturing variants**: As with names, a single `rico:Title` entity can link to multiple `rico:Name` entities to capture different textual forms (e.g., a formal title and a popular title).
- **Linking to types**: The separation allows a single conceptual title to be explicitly linked to a type (e.g., a "short title" vs. a "formal title"), without needing to associate that type with the raw text itself.

### RiC-O Entities
1. `rico:Title` (conceptual title)
2. `rico:Name` (textual value from AtoM)
3. `rico:TitleType` (shared, default: "Description title")

# Create the name and provide the textual value
:Name_XYZ_Company  a  rico:Name ;
    rico:textualValue "The Records of the XYZ Company"@en .

# Create the title entity and link it to its type ("Description title") and name
:Title_XYZ_Company  a  rico:Title ;
