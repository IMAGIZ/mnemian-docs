# `level_of_description`

**Type**: String

---

The **`rico:RecordSetType`** entity is used to categorize the specific nature or type of a `rico:RecordSet` within an archival arrangement. This directly aligns with the values found in the AtoM `level_of_description` field. We model this by creating a shared `rico:RecordSetType` entity for each unique level of description and linking it to the record set using the `rico:hasRecordSetType` property.

  - **The record entity**: The `rico:RecordSet` or `rico:RecordPart` that the level of description applies to.
  - **The specific level**: A shared `rico:RecordSetType` entity (e.g., "Fonds," "Series," "Item") that represents the specific value from the AtoM API.
