# `finding_aids`

**Type**: Array of strings

---

The `finding_aids` field describes additional finding aids that provide information about the materials being described. We model this by creating a **`rico:Record`** entity for each finding aid with the documentary form type `ric-dft:FindingAid`. These entities are then linked to the main record using the **`rico:RecordResourceToRecordResourceRelation`** property.

This model connects the following pieces of information:

  - **The main record resource**: The record (RecordSet/Record/RecordPart) being described.
  - **The finding aid record**: A `rico:Record` entity representing a finding aid.
  - **The documentary form type**: The `ric-dft:FindingAid` documentary form type attached using `rico:hasDocumentaryFormType`.
  - **The finding aid description**: The literal text from AtoM is attached to the `rico:Record` (finding aid) entity using `rico:generalDescription`.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:Record` (the finding aid as a separate record)
2.  `rico:RecordResourceToRecordResourceRelation` (the relationship between the main record and finding aid)

```turtle
# Define the Finding Aid as a separate Record
:FindingAid_123 a rico:Record ;
  rico:hasDocumentaryFormType ric-dft:FindingAid ;
  rico:generalDescription "A detailed inventory is available in the reading room. The inventory includes item-level descriptions and cross-references to related materials."@en .

# Example record set entity
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet .

# Define the relationship between the main record and finding aid
:Relation_FindingAid_123 a rico:RecordResourceToRecordResourceRelation ;
  rico:relationHasSource :RecordSet_123 ;
  rico:relationHasTarget :FindingAid_123 .
