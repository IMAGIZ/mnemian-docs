# `archival_history`

**Type**: String

---

The `archival_history` field in AtoM contains a narrative account of the record's past, including its custody and activities related to its preservation. We model this as a direct property of the record resource using **`rico:history`**. This approach is optimal because `rico:history` is a datatype property specifically designed to capture the history of an entity. It provides a simple and direct mapping for the literal value from AtoM, adhering to the "simplest available model" constraint.

The `rico:history` property is defined as:

  * **Domain**: `rico:RecordResource` (which includes `rico:RecordSet`, `rico:Record`, `rico:RecordPart`). This ensures it can be used on all levels of description.
  * **Range**: `rdfs:Literal`. This means it holds a free-text string, which is perfect for a narrative field like archival history.
