# `physical_characteristics_and_technical_requirements`

**Type**: String

---

The `physical_characteristics_and_technical_requirements` field describes the physical features, completeness, and conservation status of the record. We model this by creating a **`rico:Instantiation`** entity to hold the physical characteristics information. This entity is then linked to the record using the **`rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`** property.

This model connects the following pieces of information:

  - **The record resource**: The record (RecordSet/Record/RecordPart).
  - **The instantiation**: A `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the physical manifestation of the record.
  - **The physical characteristics**: The literal text from AtoM is attached to the `rico:Instantiation` entity using `rico:physicalCharacteristicsNote` to provide detailed information about physical features and technical requirements.

# Define the Instantiation entity for physical characteristics
:Item_123_instantiation a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:physicalCharacteristicsNote "Records are on acid-free paper with some foxing. Requires special handling due to fragile condition. Some files require specific software to access."@en .

# Example record set entity
:Item_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :Item_123_instantiation .
