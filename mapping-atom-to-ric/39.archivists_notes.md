# `archivists_notes`

**Type**: Array of strings

---

The `archivists_notes` field in AtoM (ISAD 3.7.1 Archivist's note) contains an array of unstructured note strings about the resource (record). We model this using the specialized **`rico:integrityNote`** property on the record resource, one per retrieved (AtoM) note.

This approach provides semantic distinction from general `rico:note` properties while using a property specifically designed for administrative/intellectual completeness information about record resources. The `rico:integrityNote` property is semantically appropriate for archivist notes as they often contain information about the intellectual completeness, provenance, or administrative context of records.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the record resource)

### Notes
