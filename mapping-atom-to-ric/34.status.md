# `status`

**Type**: String

---

The `status` field in AtoM describes the readiness state of the archival description itself (not the described records). This information should be attached to the digital "archival description" instantiation that every resource record has, as it explains the completion status of that specific instantiation.

The modeling pattern:
- **The archival description instantiation**: The existing `rico:Instantiation` entity representing the AtoM description (created for every resource record).
- **The status information**: The textual value from AtoM is stored with a prefix using `rico:note` on the instantiation.
- **Additional context**: This can be combined with the existing `rico:structure` property that describes the instantiation's format.

This approach correctly associates the status with the description instantiation rather than the described records, maintaining semantic accuracy while keeping the model simple.

### RiC-O Entities
1. `rico:Instantiation` (archival description instantiation; contains the status via `rico:note`)
2. `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the described resource; linked via `rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation`)

### Example

```turtle
# Core record resource
:RecordSet_123 a rico:RecordSet ;
  rico:title "Administrative Records, 1950-1960"@en .

# Digital archival description instantiation (always present)
:RecordSet_123_archival_desc a rico:Instantiation ;
  rico:carrierType :Digital ;
  rico:structure "Structured metadata, held in Access to Memory (AtoM) database"@en ;
  rico:note "Description status: Final"@en ;
  dc:source "https://atom.example.com/123" .

# Link the instantiation to the record resource
:RecordSet_123 rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation :RecordSet_123_archival_desc .
```

### Notes on description status modeling
- This approach correctly associates the status with the description instantiation, which is what the AtoM field actually describes.
- The status values (Final, Revised, Draft) indicate the readiness of the AtoM description, not the state of the described records.
- Future development may add more structured status tracking or validation workflows without changing the basic instantiation-to-status relationship.
