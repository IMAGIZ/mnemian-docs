# `rights`

**Type**: Array of objects

---

The `rights` field in AtoM contains complex metadata about intellectual property rights, copyright status, and usage conditions for records. This is one of the most complex fields to model in RiC-O as it involves multiple entities and relationships.

Mnemian does NOT currently publish Rights information in RiC as this requires additional investigation and design decisions. The mapping below is an initial assessment only and needs significant refinement based on further development and testing.

## Initial RiC-O Modeling Approach

The dedicated `IntellectualPropertyRightsRelation` class can be used to model complex rights relationships:

1. **`IntellectualPropertyRightsRelation` entities** for each rights entry
2. **Agent entities** for rights holders
3. **Date entities** for temporal aspects
4. **Supporting properties** for detailed rights information

### Key RiC-O Classes and Properties Available:

- `rico:IntellectualPropertyRightsRelation` - the main n-ary relation class for rights
- `rico:relationHasSource` - connects relation to source Agent (rights holder)
- `rico:relationHasTarget` - connects relation to target RecordResource/Instantiation
- `rico:conditionsOfUse` - for usage conditions and restrictions (on RecordResource/Instantiation)
- `rico:note` - for general rights notes (on relation or other entities)
- `rico:integrityNote` - for rights-related integrity information
- `rico:hasOrHadJurisdiction` - for copyright jurisdiction (on Agent)

### Proposed Model Structure:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart
•  rico:conditionsOfUse → "Usage conditions text"
•  (linked via relationHasTarget)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
rico:IntellectualPropertyRightsRelation
•  rico:relationHasSource → Agent (rights_holder)
•  rico:relationHasTarget → RecordResource/Instantiation
•  rico:note → "Rights note: {rights_note}"
•  rico:note → "Copyright status: {copyright_status}"
•  rico:note → "Basis: {basis}"
•  rico:note → "Copyright jurisdiction: {copyright_jurisdiction}"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
rico:Person/CorporateBody/Family/Group
•  rico:hasOrHadJurisdiction → Place (copyright_jurisdiction)
•  rico:note → "Copyright note: {copyright_note}"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
rico:Date
•  start_date/end_date periods
•  copyright_status_date
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Challenges Identified:

1. **Complex granted_rights array** - may need separate modeling approach or embedded in relation
2. **Documentation identifiers** - need to determine if these should be separate Identifier entities
3. **Temporal aspects** - multiple date fields need careful Date entity modeling
4. **Relation properties** - need to verify exact property names for the relation class

### RiC-O Entities

1. `rico:IntellectualPropertyRightsRelation` (the main rights relation entity)
2. `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the record resource)
3. `rico:Instantiation` (if rights apply to specific instantiations)
4. `rico:Agent` (rights holder)
5. `rico:Place` (copyright jurisdiction)
6. `rico:Date` (for temporal aspects)
7. `rico:Identifier` (for documentation identifiers - if needed)

## Next Steps for Refinement:

1. **Determine if granted_rights should be separate entities** or embedded in notes
2. **Clarify documentation identifier modeling** approach
3. **Test with various Rights metadata combinations** to validate the model
5. **Consider if additional RiC-O properties** are needed for specific rights aspects
