# `existence_and_location_of_copies`

**Type**: String

---

The `existence_and_location_of_copies` field in AtoM contains information about where copies of the records are located. We model this using a simple **`rico:note`** property on the record resource with a "Location of copies: " prefix.

This approach provides a straightforward way to capture information about where copies of the described records can be found, whether they are microfilm, digital copies, or other reproductions.

### RiC-O Entities

1.  `rico:RecordSet/Record/RecordPart` (the record resource with the note property)
