# `publication_status`

**Type**: String

---

The `publication_status` field represents a system-level administrative status concerning the visibility and access to a record. RiC-O is a domain ontology designed to describe the intellectual content of archival resources and their contexts, rather than the technical or administrative states of their representation within a particular system. As such, there is no RiC-O 1.1 class or property that directly corresponds to a "publication status". 

Visibility of records in RiC can be controlled via a security evaluator (Java or similar interface) within the RDF store's permissions framework, together with enforced security policies. Graph-specific permissions can then be set with different permissions for reading, writing, or managing specific graphs based on user roles. This can require extending the existing RDF Schema (RDFS) vocabulary to represent access policies, their evaluation, and enforcement processes using semantic web technologies.

**Mnemian currently does not implement these kinds of graph access controls**, so adopts this principle: If the record is within the RDF store then it is a 'public' (non restricted) resource record. We do not currently publish this AtoM field in RiC-O. Instead we use it to determine whether the 'record' (entity) should be published or not. Only 'Published' entities currently make it into RiC.   

If, in the future, we MUST export this field to RiC-O, then to maintain full compliance with the ontology, if needed, we could record it as a literal on the resource using `rico:note`. This datatype property is the most suitable way to attach this kind of unstructured, descriptive information to the archival entity within RiC, or we could link to a skos:concept. This allows us to preserve the data without inventing new entities or relationships.
